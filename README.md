# Boosting Diabetes Prediction Accuracy Using Synthetic Data and Logistic Regression via CTGAN

## Project Summary

Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe health complications if not detected and managed early. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to enhance diabetes prediction accuracy using logistic regression and synthetic data generated by the CTGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network). By synthesizing new samples, we aim to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the Diabetes Database. It includes several health measurements such as:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose:** Blood glucose level
- **BloodPressure:** Blood pressure value
- **SkinThickness:** Skin thickness measurement
- **Insulin:** Insulin level
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function indicating family history
- **Age:** Age of the individual

The label (**Outcome**) indicates:

- **0:** No diabetes
- **1:** Diabetes present

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis was performed to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values.
2. **Data Synthesis:** Synthetic data was generated using CTGAN to increase the representation of the minority class (diabetes positive cases) in the dataset.
3. **Model Training:** A logistic regression model was developed and trained using both the original dataset and the synthetic data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The model was evaluated using classification metrics, including precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualizations.

## Results

The model achieved the following evaluation metrics:

- **Precision:** 0.81 (for Outcome 0), 0.77 (for Outcome 1)
- **Recall:** 0.90 (for Outcome 0), 0.60 (for Outcome 1)
- **Accuracy:** 80%

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining synthetic data with logistic regression for enhancing diabetes prediction.

## User Input Prediction

A function is included in the project to allow users to input their health parameters for real-time diabetes prediction. This interactive component can assist individuals in assessing their diabetes risk based on the model.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:
- `data/`: Input data including the main diabetes dataset and the synthetic data generated by CTGAN.
- `figures/`: Figures and visualizations generated during data exploration and model evaluation.
