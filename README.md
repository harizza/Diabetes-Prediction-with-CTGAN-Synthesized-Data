# Boosting Diabetes Prediction Accuracy Using Synthetic Data and Logistic Regression via CTGAN

## Project Summary

Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe health complications if not detected and managed early. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to enhance diabetes prediction accuracy using logistic regression and synthetic data generated by the CTGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network). By synthesizing new samples, we aim to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

The project has been completed as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in machine learning and data science.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:
- `data/`: Input data including the main diabetes dataset and the synthetic data generated by CTGAN.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks covering different stages of the project, such as data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved model weights and predictions from the logistic regression model.
- `figures/`: Figures and visualizations generated during data exploration and model evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts implementing preprocessing, model training, and utilities.

There are three notebooks:
- `1_data_exploration.ipynb`: Data exploration and visualization.
- `2_model_training.ipynb`: Training the logistic regression model using both original and synthetic data.
- `3_user_input_prediction.ipynb`: Classifying user input for diabetes prediction.

More details are provided within the notebooks.

## Requirements

To run the project codes, you can create a new virtual environment in `conda`:
